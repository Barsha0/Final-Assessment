		<p class="para1">A spacecraft is a vehicle or machine designed to fly in outer space. A type of artificial satellite, spacecraft are used for a variety of purposes, including<br> communications, Earth observation, meteorology, navigation, space colonization, planetary exploration, and transportation of humans and cargo. All spacecraft<br> except single-stage-to-orbit vehicles cannot get into space on their own, and require a launch vehicle (carrier rocket).<br> Spaceplanes are spacecraft are built in the shape of, and function as, airplanes. The first example of such was the North American X-15 spaceplane, which <br>conducted two crewed flights which reached an altitude of over 100 km in the 1960s. The first reusable spacecraft, the X-15, was air-launched on a suborbital<br> trajectory on July 19, 1963.</p>

		<p class="para3">As of 2016, only three nations have flown crewed spacecraft: USSR/Russia, USA, and China. The first crewed spacecraft was Vostok 1, which carried Soviet <br>cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin into space in 1961, and completed a full Earth orbit. The second crewed spacecraft was named Freedom 7, and it performed a sub-<br>orbital spaceflight in 1961 carrying American astronaut Alan Shepard to an altitude of just over 187 kilometers (116 mi). There were five other crewed miss-<br>ions using Mercury spacecraft.</p>
