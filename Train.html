		<p class="para4">Astronauts on the space station stay busy. There’s lots of work to operate
        the many science experiments on board. The crew also has to make sure that the station is in top
        shape, so they clean, check equipment, maintain and repair or replace broken equipment. Crew
        members also must exercise two hours each day to stay fit and keep their bones and muscles
		strong. Sometimes we need to do a spacewalk to work outside the station in our space suit. It’s a
		tough and dangerous job but the view is terrific. The extra-vehicular activities, or EVAs, help keep
		the space station running.</p>

		<p class="para5">Astronaut training describes the complex process of preparing astronauts in regions around the world for their space missions before, during and after the<br> flight, which includes medical tests, physical training, extra-vehicular activity (EVA) training, procedure training, rehabilitation process as well as training<br> on experiments they will accomplish during their stay in space.<br><br>Virtual and physical training facilities have been integrated to familiarize astronauts with the conditions they will encounter during all phases of flight and<br> prepare astronauts for a microgravity environment. Special considerations must be made during training to ensure a safe and successful mission, which is<br> why the Apollo astronauts received training for geology field work on the Lunar surface and why research is being conducted on best practices for future ext-<br>ended missions, such as the trip to Mars.</p>
