		<p class="para"><br><br>A professional space traveler is called an astronaut.<br>
		An astronaut  is a person trained, equipped, and deployed by a human spaceflight program to serve as a commander or crew member aboard a spacecraft.<br> Although generally reserved for professional space travelers, the terms are sometimes applied to anyone who travels into space, including scientists,<br> politicians, journalists and tourists. "Astronaut" technically applies to all human space travelers regardless of nationality or allegiance; however, astronauts<br> fielded by Russia or the Soviet Union are typically known instead as cosmonauts in order to distinguish them from American or otherwise NATO-oriented<br> space travellers. </p>
